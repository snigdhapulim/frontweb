# Primary Doctor Recommendation System - Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for the Primary Doctor Recommendation System, an innovative platform designed to match patients with primary care doctors based on a variety of factors, including patient preferences, doctor specialties, and more. Our system uses an adapted item-based collaborative filtering approach to group patient-doctor similarity pairs, enhancing the matchmaking process.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** NextJS

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
